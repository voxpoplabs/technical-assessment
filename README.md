# Technical Assessment - Political Survey Application

This is a React + Express.js starter kit for a political survey application designed for technical interviews at VoxPop Labs. 

## Assessment Format

**Important:** The code is provided in advance, but the actual assessment will be conducted live during the interview. You'll be asked to add new features to this existing codebase while demonstrating your technical skills and problem-solving approach.

⚒️ You may use any tools, IDE, or development environment you're comfortable with.

📚 You may also add any library that you want.

🙋‍♂️ You can ask any question or clarification that you want.


## Getting Started
